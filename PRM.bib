    abstract={Author's note. From about 1923 onwards the Statistical Department at Rothamsted had been much concerned with the precision of field experiments in agriculture, and with modifications in their design, having the dual aim of increasing the precision and of providing a valid estimate of error. These two desiderata had been somewhat confused in the minds of the experimenters, and the present paper was the author's first attempt at setting out the rational principles on which he might proceed. The paper is a precursor to the book on the Design of Experiments published nine years later.},

    title={The design of experiments},
    edition={1},
    publisher={Oliver & Boyd},        
    address={Edinburgh},  
    abstract={Different types of experimentation are considered with reference to their logical structure, to show that valid conclusions may be drawn from them without using the disputed theory of inductive inferences, i.e., of arguing from observation to explanatory theory. This is possible if a null hypothesis is explicitly formulated when the experiment is designed; this hypothesis can never be proved, but may be disproved with whatever probability one will accept as demonstrating a positive result. Chapters II, III, and IV illustrate simple applications of the principles involved in sensitiveness, significance, tests of wider hypotheses, validity, and estimation and elimination of error. More elaborate structures are treated in later chapters. Chapter titles are: (V) the Latin square; (VI) factorial design in experimentation; (VII) confounding; (VIII) special cases of partial confounding; (IX) increase of precision by concomitant measurements: statistical control; (X) generalization of null hypotheses: fiducial probability; (XI) measurement of amount of information in general.},

    abstract={Are scientific disciplines really different? This question often crystallizes into the old debate: Are Physics and Biology different? If Physics and Biology worked on highly different entities (objects), or if they had highly different methods, it would be straightforward to close the debate by a negative answer. However, if we cannot identify any differences, we should explore more deeply the status of the laws found in Physics and questioned in Biology. By slightly modifying the definition of what is a law, I argue here that both disciplines possess some laws exhibiting various “degrees of confirmation”. I finally propose explanations for why P and B give the illusion differing radically, although they both belong to the same continuum of a unified scientific domain.},
